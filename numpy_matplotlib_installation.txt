1) Install Python 2.7 
2) To install pip, follow the instructions from here - http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/

In brief, go to MS Powershell
- Test whether typing "python" in the terminal shows you a python prompt (this is indicative of proper python installation and path specification).
- Skip "ez_setup.py"
- right click on the link "get-pip.py" and download it to the same directory as your "Python27" folder.

3) Download required Numpy package from here  " http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/  "   and install in the same path as  your Python 2.7 
- to test whether it has been done properly , open your MS Powershell terminal , type "python". Once you can run python in your terminal, type "import numpy". 
If you get a newline python prompt (and no error messages), you're good to go.

4) to install MatPlotLib ,
- download from here - http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html . 

To resolve dependency errors - download "dateutil" , "PyParsing" and "Six" from ---- http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
